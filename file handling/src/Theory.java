  STREAMS
A stream in Java is a sequence of data. It is a fundamental concept in Java's I/O system, allowing the program to interact with data sources (files, network sockets, memory, etc.) or destinations (files, consoles, network streams) sequentially, one byte or character at a time.
Streams abstract away the details of how data is read or written, making it easier for developers to perform input and output operations.

there are  basically 2 types of streams-> byte streams and character streams

Byte Streams:
->Operate on raw binary data (bytes).
->Use InputStream and OutputStream classes and their subclasses.
->Suitable for handling non-text data, like images, audio, and video.

Character Streams:
->Operate on text data (characters).
->Use Reader and Writer classes and their subclasses.

Java provides classes and methods in the java.io and java.nio.file packages for file handling.

Key Classes for File Handling

->File Class (for file/directory operations)
Create new files or directories.
Check properties like file existence, readability, writability, etc.
Delete files.
->FileWriter and FileReader (for writing/reading text files)

->FileWriter: Used to write data to a file.
->FileReader: Used to read data from a file.
->BufferedReader and BufferedWriter
Provide efficient reading/writing by buffering characters.
->PrintWriter
Used to write formatted text.
->Scanner (for reading files)
Reads input from a file in a structured way.
->Files Class (introduced in Java 7, in java.nio.file)
Performs file operations such as copying, moving, deleting, etc.
