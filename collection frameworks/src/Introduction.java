    /*
    The Java Collection Framework provides a set of interfaces and classes to work with data structures like lists, sets, maps, and streams.
     It simplifies operations such as searching, sorting, insertion, manipulation, and deletion.

    List
    Definition: An ordered collection (sequence) that allows duplicate elements.
    Common Implementations:
    ArrayList: Resizable array.
    LinkedList: Doubly-linked list.
    Vector: Synchronized ArrayList (rarely used now).
    Important Methods:add(element), get(index), set(index, element), remove(index).

    Set
    Definition: A collection that does not allow duplicate elements.
    Common Implementations:
    HashSet: Unordered, uses a hash table.
    LinkedHashSet: Maintains insertion order.
    TreeSet: Sorted set (uses a red-black tree).
    Important Methods:add(element), remove(element), contains(element).

    Map
    Definition: A collection of key-value pairs.
    Common Implementations:
    HashMap: Unordered, allows one null key.
    LinkedHashMap: Maintains insertion order.
    TreeMap: Sorted map.
    Important Methods:
    put(key, value), get(key), remove(key), containsKey(key).
