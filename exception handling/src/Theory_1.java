EXCEPTIONS VS ERRORS
In Java, Exceptions and Errors are both subclasses of the Throwable class and are used to indicate that an exceptional situation has occurred in the program. However, there are some key differences between Exceptions and Errors:

Purpose: Exceptions are meant to be caught and handled by the programmer, while Errors are usually not intended to be caught and handled, but instead indicate a severe problem that should be addressed by the programmer.

Type: Exceptions are usually associated with expected or recoverable problems, such as a file not found or a network connection failure, while Errors indicate serious, non-recoverable problems, such as an out-of-memory error.

Use: Exceptions can be caught and handled using a try-catch block, while Errors typically cannot be caught and handled. Instead, the JVM will generate an error message and shut down.

Examples: Examples of Exceptions include IOException, SQLException, and NullPointerException, while examples of Errors include OutOfMemoryError, StackOverflowError, and VirtualMachineError.

In conclusion, it's important to understand the difference between Exceptions and Errors in Java and to handle Exceptions appropriately in your code, while not trying to catch Errors, which indicate serious problems that need to be addressed by the programmer.
